# Program Test Case Checker Written in Linux Shell

This is a simple shell script written for automating the process of comparing a program's outputs with sample outputs. The script can be used to check the correctness of a program by checking if the outputs match the expected outputs.

I wrote this for checking my programming assignments. I am not a professional so I cannot guarantee the script's correctness. Use it at your own discretion.

# How to use
1. I hard coded some of the file names and directories in the script. Configure the directories and rename your testcases under the following rule so that they work with my script:
    - The sample test cases must be put in a folder, in which the folder must be put in the same directory as the program
    - The sample test cases must be named under the following rule : (input/output)(program name)_\(integer).txt, in which the integer should start from 1
      - For example, you have a program ```foobar``` and two pair of testcases.
      - You should create a folder under the same path as foobar.exe
      - inside the folder
        - the first input pair should be named as ```inputfoobar_1.txt``` ```outputfoobar_1.txt```
        - the second input pair should be named as ```inputfoobar_2.txt``` ```outputfoobar_2.txt```
2. Download the script, put the script under the same path as the program
3. Run the script with 3 parameters:
    - The first parameter: the program name
    - The second parameter: the folder name
    - The third parameter: number of test case pairs
    - As an example, to run the script for the ```foobar``` program above, if the test case folder is named as ```testcases```, the command would be ```./test.sh foobar testcases 2```
4. The result will be echo'd on console. If there are any errors when the script tries to run the test cases, the program will create a text file testError.txt and write the errors into that file
